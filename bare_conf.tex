% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

More than $250$ million poople worldwide have moderate to severe vision impairment, while ($\approx 36$ million are blind) \cite{Bourne}. During the past decades significant effort was devoted to develop computer vision and other sensor based aids (e.g. \cite{Caraiman}, \cite{Csapo}, \cite{Poggi}, \cite{Zientara}) for helping the blind and visually impaired users to perceive the surrounding world. However, computer vision is rapidly evolving field, and systems based on the aforementioned approaches often lack accuracy and reliability in real-world conditions. In this article we describe a system, which employs modern computer vision techniques for compensation of lost or impaired vision function in humans. Many of the previuosly proposed electronic aids for the blind count on highly specialised hardware, for instance smart glassess \cite{Zientara}, Microsoft Kinnect sensors \cite{Owayjan}, helmet-mounted photosensors and cameras \cite{Larisa}. Such advanced and costly technology brings additional complexity into daily tasks, which visually impaired people currently manage by the help of the white cane. This project puts major emphasis on developing a tool, which seamlesly integrates with the hardware visually impaired person already has on-hand and is used to (smartphone). This paper describes the high level architecture of the proposed technology aid for visually impaired people. 


\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Following the principles of participatory design \cite{Kensing}, \cite{Carroll} we included the final users into the design process of the system. Two visually impaired persons participated in discussion and focus group meetings together with the project team to identify the key properties of the solution. During the six discussion sessions major attention was paid to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Functionality and key features of the solution addressing real-life scenarios of visually impaired persons;
\item Technical feasibility, connecting user needs to the latest development in computer vision and assisted technologies;
\item Interface between the visually impaired person and the assisted technology;
\item Appearance, usability and potential costs of the final product. 
\end{enumerate}
Design process involved testing of the existing technological solutions (mobile phone apps) for assisting visually impaired persons {\color{red}(which ones have we tested?)}. Semi-structured tests were performed by the visually impaired participants accompanied by a researcher from a project group. Strengths and weaknesses of the existing solutions are reflected in the design of the proposed system.

Following the above methodology we suggest the impaired human vision compensation system (\textbf{HVCS}), consisting of \textbf{Device} and \textbf{Inference} components (see Fig.~\ref{fig:schematics}).

\textbf{Device} subsystem is a computational device the user currently uses for completing other daily tasks. It consists of sensors and actuators, integrated into smartphone-based computation core, which was chosen due its avialability to wide population, and capability to perform the required computations or forward visual information to the external server via Internet connection. Sensors are mounted on forehead belt include: RGB camera, depth camera, IMU. Actuator set consists of bone conductive headphones, and head belt for presenting tactile-feedback to the user. %We suggest to use bone conductive headphones, ... 

\textbf{Inference} subsystem consists of server computer with internet connection and set of computer vision algorithms, selected according to our methodology (see. Sec.~\ref{sec:method}): Faster RCNN object detector \cite{?}, trained to detect important objects (doors, floors, elevators, stairs, corridor junctions, etc.), CNN-RNN-based scene description \cite{Liu},\cite{Ren}, \cite{Dai}, place recognition \cite{Ohn-Bar}, face recognition \cite{Amos}, obstacle detection \cite{Laina}, and possibly other modules. 

HVCS operation cycle is started by \textbf{Device} reading sensor data and transmitting it to the server for an analysis. Server calculates feedback signal and transmits it back to the device for presenting to the user.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%Didzioji Discussion teksto dalis man labiau tinka prie Results/Conclusion. Gal galim padiskutioti daugiau apie Limitations, Future Implications, Lessons Learned ar pan... Cia galime savo siuloma sistema lyginti su anksciau publikuotais rezultatais. 

In this article we outlined an idea of complex computer vision-based sensor architecture, which can help to partially compensate impaired or lost human sight. Main improvements comparing to similar previous work (\cite{?}, \cite{?}) is: ability to use efficient (but still computationally intensive) modern computer vision algorithms via Internet connection, present the signal to the user by combined bone conductive headphone-tactile actuator, low cost and consequently increased potential availability of the device. Suggested architecture can be used as basis for various computer vision-based systems, allowing to help visually impaired users in everyday routines (e.g. outdoor/indoor navigation,...). On the other side, due to remotelly carried visual analysis, in some cases the suggested system may suffer from too large latency, its reliability depends on stability and quality of Internet connection. Such a problem partially may be solved in near future, when 5G networks will prevail.


%The developed head-mounted tactile device is developed for head position and orientation tracking and could capture an image in front of visually impaired people. The tactile device with integrated 3D deph camera is integrated with smartphone by bluetooth which could preprocess the labeled image features. The developed high quality self navigation system is based on the computer vision methods especially enhancing the capabilities to detect and classify objects (e.g bus station, street crossings, ) with their surrounding objects. The authors expect to increase the capabilies of potentially blind to secure navigate especially for the planed destination (e.g. "home-office"). Work left (outdoor/indoor) etc.
